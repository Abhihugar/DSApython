Searching Algorithm
--------------------
    Searching algorithm are designed to check for an element or
    retrieve and element from any data structure where it is sorted.


Based on the type of search operation. these algorithms are generally
classified into two categories:
    1)Sequential Search:
            In this the list or array is traversed sequentially and every
            element is checked.

            10-->20---->30---->40---->--->50----60>  50 to be searched

    2) Interval Search:
            These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in
            sorted data-structures.these type of searching algorithms are
            much more efficient than linear search as they repeatedly target
            the center of the search structure and divide the search space in
            half.
